# Multitenancy Implementation ToDo List

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Created Tenant model with subdomain, domain, and branding settings
- [x] Added tenant_id to all existing tables (users, curricula, chapters, lessons, bookmarks, etc.)
- [x] Created TenantMiddleware for subdomain-based tenant identification
- [x] Set up Current.tenant using ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes
- [x] Added default_scope to ApplicationRecord for tenant isolation
- [x] Updated all models with belongs_to :tenant associations
- [x] Created comprehensive seeds.rb with 3 demo tenants (acme1, acme2, acme3)
- [x] Added tenant registration and settings controllers
- [x] Created branding controller for dynamic CSS generation
- [x] Updated development configuration for subdomain testing
- [x] Fixed middleware loading issues
- [x] Basic subdomain routing is working (confirmed login works for all tenants)

## üîß Current Issues to Fix
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Tenant isolation not working properly - all tenants see same data
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Default scope may not be applying correctly
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Need to verify tenant_id is being set correctly in all models

## üöÄ Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Fix Tenant Isolation (URGENT)
- [ ] Debug why default_scope isn't working properly
- [ ] Verify Current.tenant is being set correctly in middleware
- [ ] Test tenant isolation with API endpoints
- [ ] Ensure all models properly scope to current tenant

### 2. Git & Deployment
- [ ] Commit all changes to git
- [ ] Push to master branch
- [ ] Deploy to production using Kamal
- [ ] Test production deployment with subdomains

### 3. Frontend Integration
- [ ] Dynamic CSS loading for tenant branding
- [ ] Tenant registration UI
- [ ] Tenant settings UI
- [ ] Subdomain detection in frontend
- [ ] Update frontend to use tenant-specific API endpoints

### 4. Subscription & Billing
- [ ] Stripe integration for subscriptions
- [ ] Subscription tiers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
- [ ] Usage limits and quotas
- [ ] Billing dashboard for admins
- [ ] Payment processing and webhooks

### 5. Security & Access Control
- [ ] Admin role management
- [ ] User invitations and onboarding
- [ ] Access control policies
- [ ] Audit logging for tenant actions
- [ ] API rate limiting per tenant

### 6. Analytics & Monitoring
- [ ] Tenant analytics dashboard
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Usage reports
- [ ] Billing analytics
- [ ] System health monitoring

### 7. Advanced Features
- [ ] Custom domains support
- [ ] White-label options
- [ ] API rate limiting
- [ ] Data export functionality
- [ ] Backup & recovery per tenant

### 8. Documentation & Support
- [ ] API documentation for multitenant endpoints
- [ ] Admin guide for tenant management
- [ ] User guide for tenant-specific features
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Migration guide for existing users

## üîç Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for tenant isolation
- [ ] Performance optimization for tenant queries
- [ ] Database indexing for tenant_id columns
- [ ] Caching strategies for tenant-specific data
- [ ] Error handling for tenant-related issues

## üìã Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test tenant isolation with all API endpoints
- [ ] Verify subdomain routing works in production
- [ ] Test tenant registration flow
- [ ] Test tenant settings and branding
- [ ] Test user authentication across tenants
- [ ] Test data isolation between tenants
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple tenants

## üö® Known Issues
1. **Tenant Isolation**: Default scope may not be working correctly
2. **Database**: Need to verify all tenant_id values are set correctly
3. **Middleware**: May need additional error handling for invalid subdomains
4. **Seeds**: May have duplicate data creation issues

## üìù Notes
- Current implementation uses "Shared Database/Shared Schema" approach
- Tenant identification via subdomain
- Branding customization via dynamic CSS
- All existing functionality preserved with tenant context
- Ready for production deployment once isolation is fixed
