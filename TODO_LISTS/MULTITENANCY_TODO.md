# Multitenancy Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Completed (All Critical Features)

### Core Multitenancy
- [x] Created Tenant model with subdomain, domain, and branding settings
- [x] Added tenant_id to all existing tables (users, curricula, chapters, lessons, bookmarks, etc.)
- [x] Created TenantMiddleware for subdomain-based tenant identification
- [x] Set up Current.tenant using ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes
- [x] Added default_scope to ApplicationRecord for tenant isolation
- [x] Updated all models with belongs_to :tenant associations
- [x] Created comprehensive seeds.rb with 3 demo tenants (acme1, acme2, acme3)
- [x] Added tenant registration and settings controllers
- [x] Created branding controller for dynamic CSS generation
- [x] Updated development configuration for subdomain testing
- [x] Fixed middleware loading issues
- [x] Basic subdomain routing is working (confirmed login works for all tenants)

### Critical Fixes
- [x] **FIXED**: Tenant isolation bug in ApplicationRecord default_scope
- [x] **FIXED**: Corrected tenant_id column usage instead of tenant column
- [x] **FIXED**: Added condition to only apply scope to models with tenant_id column
- [x] **FIXED**: Updated set_tenant method to use correct column name
- [x] **FIXED**: Verified tenant isolation is working correctly

### Testing & Verification
- [x] Created debug_tenants.rb script for tenant isolation testing
- [x] Verified each tenant only sees their own unique content
- [x] Tested API endpoints with tenant context
- [x] Confirmed data isolation between tenants
- [x] Validated unique content for each tenant (no confusion about isolation)

### Deployment & Git
- [x] Committed all changes to git
- [x] Pushed to master branch
- [x] Ready for production deployment

## üéØ Current Status: PRODUCTION READY

The multitenancy implementation is **complete and working correctly**. All critical features have been implemented and tested:

### ‚úÖ Verified Working Features
- **Tenant Isolation**: Each tenant only sees their own data
- **Unique Content**: Each tenant has distinct curricula and content
- **Subdomain Routing**: Middleware correctly identifies tenants
- **API Endpoints**: All endpoints respect tenant context
